# Climate Action Reserve â€” CO2 Emission Reduction

This project is also available as [a GitHub project](https://github.com/HarishKM7/Climate-Action-Reserve-CO2-Emission-Reduction).

The Climate Action Reserve (CAR) has [a list of projects](https://thereserve2.apx.com/myModule/rpt/myrpt.asp?r=111) that perform carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction.

This microservice returns the details for a given project.

For example, a GET request to `MICROSERVICE_ENDPOINT/project/1458` returns:

```json
{
  "project_id": "CAR1458",
  "arb_id": "CAOD6458",
  "cooperative_aggregate_id": "",

}
```

## How it Works

The `microservice.js` file first loads the CSV of all projects from disk, converts its contents to JSON & keeps this in memory. Whenever an incoming request is received, details of the requested project are returned from this in-memory JSON.

The GitHub actions workflow builds the microservice & runs unit tests (if any).
